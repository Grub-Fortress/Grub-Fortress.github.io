		TF:Grub Progress Update 3
	</div>by Grub, Feb 9th, 2026<br><br>
        Hello there, Grub here as always, just thought I'd make an progress update post, since I haven't done those in a while.<br>
		you might have noticed noticed the website got a significant overhaul, compared to the old one, this one's 10 times better in my opinion
		<img src="images/post1/old-site.png" alt="Old Website" style="width:770px;"><br>
		Yeah, that doesn't look the best, I mean you could say it had the old 2008 charm, but eh, It wasn't really the most usable, so that why I decided to replace it with this one
		<div id="MainText_TitleStandalone"><br>
			Another Main Menu Update
		</div>
		Yeah, I updated the main menu yet again, after 0015 I thought It'd be worth updating yet again, The old one wasn't unusable, but it could've been better
		<img src="images/post1/newmenu.png" alt="new menu" style="width:770px;"><br>
		I think I'm actually happy with this one, There isn't anything unnecessary, the useless bottom bar has been completely removed, new SFM renders were made, buttons were made larger
		<div id="MainText_TitleStandalone"><br>
			New Class Portraits
		</div>
		Thanks to JarateIsCool, We've got new Class Portraits for the classes, as the ones currently within TF2 are quite outdated, with a lot of them being either lazily recolored or using beta variants

			LUX Shaders Intergration
		</div>
		<img src="images/post1/lux.png" alt="Scout" style="width:450px;"><br>
		LUX was Implemented into TF:Grub, Since it has released, just thought I might as well implement it into the mod, it does allow for Parallax Corrected cubemaps, Disabling half-lambert on Materials with phong, and lots of other stuff.<br>
		The LUX Shaders repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/LUX-Shaders-Team/LUX-Shaders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a><br>
		<div id="MainText_TitleStandalone"><br>
			Closing notes
		</div>
		Well, that's just the stuff I decided to showcase, there's some other stuff in the works that might or might not end up in 0016, I hope that 0016 will come out quickly, I guess I'll just have to get it to a state which I'm willing to call it ready. Have fun Grubbin.
